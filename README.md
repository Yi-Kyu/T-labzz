**Terminal Lab Preparation Automation – by Yi-Kyu**

**T-labzz** is a pure Bash automation utility designed to prepare your terminal and folder structure for efficient pentesting workflows.  
Inspired by s4vitar's environment, this tool runs under root and performs a clean, structured setup for your engagements.

Unlike flashy tools, **T-labzz** avoids unnecessary aesthetics to keep things fast, minimal, and functional.

## ⚙️ What It Does

T-labzz automates:

- Terminal workspace initialization
- Directory structure creation for new targets
- IPv4 format validation
- Root-level setup commands
- Smart tab labeling using `xdotool`

All of this happens automatically from the moment the script runs.

## ⚠️ Important Note

**Once T-labzz starts running, do not close or switch the terminal.**  
Interrupting it mid-process may cause misconfigurations or incomplete setups.

---

## 🔐 Root Access Required

T-labzz checks your UID and will exit if not run with `sudo` or as `root`.  
This ensures proper creation of directories and execution of terminal commands.

## 🚀 Installation
